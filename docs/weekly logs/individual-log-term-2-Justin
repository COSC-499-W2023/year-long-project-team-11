# Week 2 (Jan 15 - Jan 21)
This week I completed my merge of my AI API feature, we were previously having trouble with. I also worked with Depar on sorting out how that feature would link with his Save Content feature. 


# Week 1 (Jan 8 - Jan 14)
After talking with other teams during the Thursday session, I was informed of Python libraries that other teams were using for slide generation. So this week I ended up mostly researching those libraries for slide generation (python-pptx), as well as looking at the OpenAI assistant API which another group was using to process file uploads.
