# Week 4

This week, we spent writing our project plan. We discussed the Project Plan and divided the tasks among everyone. I wrote the Envisioned Usage in the Project Plan, which targets teachers and professors, and helped make the table for Teamwork Distribution and Anticipated Hurdles. The last big thing we did was to plan out tasks for our major milestones. This was the toughest one because we need to plan out months of what features to implement for the project.

# Week 5

This week we had a meeting about the layout and design of the web application that we are going to code. Most of my work is making the template and doing nice visuals so that is what I did. I did the layout template page of Login, Logout, and Signup.

- My major issue for this week was I had the flu and had major back pain and headaches and so I was out for almost the whole week and couldn't get any major progress done
- Another issue was a technical issue when setting up new code given by a group member. To make up for that lost time, I have setup placeholder stuff on my local directory and tried to help others with their own issues
