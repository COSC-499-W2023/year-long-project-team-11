# Week 4

This week, we spent writing our project plan. We discussed the Project Plan and divided the tasks among everyone. I wrote the Envisioned Usage in the Project Plan, which targets teachers and professors, and helped make the table for Teamwork Distribution and Anticipated Hurdles. The last big thing we did was to plan out tasks for our major milestones. This was the toughest one because we need to plan out months of what features to implement for the project.
