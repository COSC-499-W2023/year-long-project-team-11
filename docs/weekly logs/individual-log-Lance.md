# Week 4

This week, we spent writing our project plan. We discussed the Project Plan and divided the tasks among everyone. I wrote the Envisioned Usage in the Project Plan, which targets teachers and professors, and helped make the table for Teamwork Distribution and Anticipated Hurdles. The last big thing we did was to plan out tasks for our major milestones. This was the toughest one because we need to plan out months of what features to implement for the project.

# Week 5

This week we had a meeting about the layout and design of the web application that we are going to code. Most of my work is making the template and doing nice visuals so that is what I did. I did the layout template page of Login, Logout, and Signup.

# Week 6 (October 8-15)

- This week, we completed the rough draft of the user interface for pages in the web application.
- We split up work for the group to complete certain tasks for our first major milestone.
- To achieve this, I'm working on the CSS of the Login Page and if possible, help others with their work
- We had a few issues trying to figure out which pages were important and which were not as important for the presentation.
