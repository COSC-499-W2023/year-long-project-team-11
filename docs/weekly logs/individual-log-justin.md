# Week 4

We spent this week writing our project plan, this involved a lot of discussion amongst the team about our vision for the final product. I was in charge of writing the section detailing the stack we are planning to use, and had to write our justifications behind choosing each technology. The last big thing that we had to do for the plan was to plan out the tasks for our major milestones. This required lots of thought on features that we wanted to implement down the line.
