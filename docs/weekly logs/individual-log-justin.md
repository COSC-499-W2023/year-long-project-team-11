# Week 5
Our main goal this week was to establish a more concrete idea of how our app will work and get some initial designs of our UI done based on that functionality. We met on Thursday and started making putting together some designs using Canva. The main issue we ran into when designing our UI was how we would lay out the AI generation page in a way that wasn't too overwhelming for the user, while also still giving them enough options to specify.

# Week 4

We spent this week writing our project plan, this involved a lot of discussion amongst the team about our vision for the final product. I was in charge of writing the section detailing the stack we are planning to use, and had to write our justifications behind choosing each technology. The last big thing that we had to do for the plan was to plan out the tasks for our major milestones. This required lots of thought on features that we wanted to implement down the line.
