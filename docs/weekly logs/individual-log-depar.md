# Individual Log Week 4
This week we worked on creating the foundational work for our year long Capstone project. This will help us in the long run to keep track of our milestones. On September 24th we had a meeting and discussed on delegating portions of the project plan and worked on its compeletion on the 26th. The task I worked on was teamwork distributon and anticipated hurdles. I mainly learnt about understanding the arduous task on making a concise project plan. On Oct 1st we spent a quick hour to recap and finish up individual logs and peer evals for a weekly submission

# Individual Log Week 5
This week we worked on creating the design of our website. We started working on October 4th and made some progress. Currently there is no exact end date but we plan to finish it all up by next week at latest. The current milestone of this week is to finish as many Canva pages as possible. The task I worked on was creating the main page of the Generative AI and the logout page. I mainly learnt creating a good foundation to smooth the process of development.

# Individual Log Week 6-7
During Week 6 our main goal was page design creation. On Oct 17th I formated the user AI input and output pages and on Oct 19th we finished our milestone of Canva project creation. With all the pages finalized we began on assigning tasks of page creation and I was tasked to create css files. 
During Week 7 we are creating web pages using ReactJS. I am waiting on my teammates to finish their creation of login/logout pages so I can begin the CSS process. During our discussion last week we determined CSS formatting to be on the lower priority so we are currently aiming to finish the form of the pages and setting up the docker environment and then move onto CSS.
