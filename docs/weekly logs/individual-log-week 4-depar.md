# Individual Log Week 4
This week we worked on creating the foundational work for our year long Capstone project. This will help us in the long run to keep track of our milestones. On September 24th we had a meeting and discussed on delegating portions of the project plan and worked on its compeletion on the 26th. The task I worked on was teamwork distributon and anticipated hurdles. I mainly learnt about understanding the arduous task on making a concise project plan. On Oct 1st we spent a quick hour to recap and finish up individual logs and peer evals for a weekly submission

# Individual Log Week 5
This week we worked on creating the design of our website. We started working on October 4th and made some progress. Currently there is no exact end date but we plan to finish it all up by next week at latest. The current milestone of this week is to finish as many Canva pages as possible. The task I worked on was creating the main page of the Generative AI and the logout page. I mainly learnt creating a good foundation to smooth the process of development.
