# Individual Log Week 4
This week we worked on creating the foundational work for our year long Capstone project. This will help us in the long run to keep track of our milestones. On September 24th we had a meeting and discussed on delegating portions of the project plan and worked on its compeletion on the 26th. The task I worked on was teamwork distributon and anticipated hurdles. I mainly learnt about understanding the arduous task on making a concise project plan. On Oct 1st we spent a quick hour to recap and finish up individual logs and peer evals for a weekly submission
