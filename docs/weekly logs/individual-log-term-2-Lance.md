# ===== TERM 2 =====
# Week 1
This week I planned to finish the User Profile page that I could not do over the break as I lost the motivation to do it while taking the winter break. For this week, we managed to discuss on what features we need to get done by the end of January. I am now going to work on finishing the User Profile page as well as Setting up automated tests for the past tasks we did on term 1.
