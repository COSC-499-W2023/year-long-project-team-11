# ===== TERM 2 =====
# Week 4 (January 29-February 4)
This week we had the first peer testing of our website. I learned a lot from testing the first team's food app and the second team's AI generation website.= Before the day of presentation, I worked on adding the info of the user profile by getting info from a user in the database. I have also added a favicon image and the logo for the website. I had tons of help troubleshooting by the whole group as we were trying to find out why our docker was having errors in running some pages.
# Week 3 (January 22-28)
This week I worked on setting up the user profile. I am troubleshooting the hashing password error with Ryan, and Justin has helped me figure out the js-cookie problem everyone has been having. Now I need to clean up the user profile more and make the page populated with the database.

# Week 2 (January 15-21)
This week I had planned to implement the database profile into the user profile page, but that ended up not happening as I was troubleshooting the docker to work with the js-cookie from the npm install option. This week just ended up troubleshooting the errors in setting up the docker server. For next week, I hope to finish the database to show in the user profile page, and if I have extra time, to start making automated tests from the past tasks that we did.

# Week 1 (January 8-14)
This week I planned to finish the User Profile page that I could not do over the break as I lost the motivation to do it while taking the winter break. For this week, we managed to discuss on what features we need to get done by the end of January. I am now going to work on finishing the User Profile page as well as Setting up automated tests for the past tasks we did on term 1.
