Note: The burn up chart shows everything being completed on the last day as we had all tasks roughly ongoing and under review until the final day. This choice was due to the nature of this weeks tasks being solely writing project plan.
Note: There is only one branch in the network as all the work for the project plan was done in the actual Google Doc.

<b>*</b> <i>There are no test files or commit graphs as the only things that actually got pushed to Github this time are the logs.</i>

<b>*</b> <i>There were no issues with this week of the project. All members collaborated well and managed to solve any issues that came up.</i>

All members contributed to the design of the template on Thursday. The Thursday was our only working day this week as the group decided it was best to prioritize the midterms people are having both this week, and in the coming week. Planned to be finalized by next Thursday where we will break into groups to tackle the remaining 2 tasks.

* _No Burnup chart as the only task this week was not meant to be completed._
* _There are once again no code nor commits pushed this week as we focused solely on perfecting our template. This way the group will be all on the same page when implementing the design._

The milestones for this week were to complete our individually assigned features. Some members, however, were unable to achieve these milestones however, some due to midterm prep, and others from waiting on other group members. The team has decided on a strict deadline of this upcoming Thursday (October 26), by which all assigned tasks must be completed.

The milestones for this week were originally to have our HTML and CSS files done for Login and Logout, which were completed. We then recieved news on Tuesday from a TA, however, that we had been working under incorrect instructions and had not fully met the requirements for the mini-presentation yet. After learning this, the team added new milestones such as having a form validation and testing, and having multiple web design variations. All these new milestones were completed by Sunday and the team is now working towards a new milestone of getting a functional database set up, as well as completing the creating the "Create User" page.

This week, the team completed many milestones on short order while also finalizing and presenting the project. The project now has a functioning database, form validation and error handling for "create user" and "sign in", a proper landing page, refined CSS styling, and various test cases for all the input fields to ensure that only valid entries are allowed through. This week the team also refined our script and powerpoint for the mini-presentation, which we also performed this week.

This week, the team mainly focused on work in other courses, such as midterms and assignments, and decided to begin a deep dive into work a few days into the break once everyone has had a chance to refresh themselves. The work we did do this week consisted of reworking and reorganizing some of our pre-planned future tasks. A number of previously planned future tasks had to be reworked/shuffled around due to the confusion with our previous TA. Once everything was re-worked, the group decided on who will be completing which tasks, while also setting a firm date of having at least one task done by the Friday of the break. The tasks we have assigned ourselves can be seen in our task list (above image) and Kanban Board (below image).

These past 2 weeks, the team aimed to complete 1 feature by the end of the break, but we unfortunatly failed. Despite this however, progress is being made, and team members are working extra hard this week to meet the project milestone of 2 features per member, fully completed by December 3rd.

This week, the team focused on finishing their features to meet the design milestone on the 3rd. This work was mainly coding for our features, as well as writing the design document and filming the video.
We ran into some difficulties late but managed to finish our features and get the document and video done.
