<b>Burn Up Chart</b>

Note: The burn up chart shows everything being completed on the last day as we had all tasks roughly ongoing and under review until the final day. This choice was due to the nature of this weeks tasks being solely writing project plan.
Note: There is only one branch in the network as all the work for the project plan was done in the actual Google Doc.

<b>*</b> <i>There are no test files or commit graphs as the only things that actually got pushed to Github this time are the logs.</i>

<b>*</b> <i>There were no issues with this week of the project. All members collaborated well and managed to solve any issues that came up.</i>

<h1>Week 5</h1>
<b>List of Tasks</b>
<img width="1373" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 11 17 14 PM" src="https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-11/assets/71360902/ec917f61-fc0b-4468-9b09-f8d925502656">
All members contributed to the design of the template on Thursday. The Thursday was our only working day this week as the group decided it was best to prioritize the midterms people are having both this week, and in the coming week. Planned to be finalized by next Thursday where we will break into groups to tackle the remaining 2 tasks.

* _No Burnup chart as the only task this week was not meant to be completed._
* _There are once again no code nor commits pushed this week as we focused solely on perfecting our template. This way the group will be all on the same page when implementing the design._
