<h1> =================== Term 2 =================== </h1>

**Week 1**
This week and over the break I had planned to get a brand new feature done to get ahead, but was sapped of motivation and ended up forgoing that goal. I did however managed to fix the password hashing problem our team was having for our "create user" page. Users can now sign up and log in properly, and their passwords are stored in an encrypted format. I have also begun work on implementaing a "Navigation bar" feature, but have not uploaded anything to Github yet as it is not in any kind of usable state yet.

I also performed some management duties this week by assisting in task allocation and priority setting, as well as ensuring that the team is all on the same page in regards to what is expected of us this term. I ran a mini retrospective meeting to help the team understand what was good and bad about last term, as well as how we should be moving forward going into this next term.
