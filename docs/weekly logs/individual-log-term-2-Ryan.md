<h1> =================== Term 2 =================== </h1>

**Week 1**
This week and over the break I had planned to get a brand new feature done to get ahead, but was sapped of motivation and ended up forgoing that goal. I did however managed to fix the password hashing problem our team was having for our "create user" page. Users can now sign up and log in properly, and their passwords are stored in an encrypted format. I have also begun work on implementaing a "Navigation bar" feature, but have not uploaded anything to Github yet as it is not in any kind of usable state yet.
