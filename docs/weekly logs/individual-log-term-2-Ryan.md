<h1> =================== Term 2 =================== </h1>

**Week 1**
This week and over the break I had planned to get a brand new feature done to get ahead, but was sapped of motivation and ended up forgoing that goal. I did however managed to fix the password hashing problem our team was having for our "create user" page. Users can now sign up and log in properly, and their passwords are stored in an encrypted format. I have also begun work on implementaing a "Navigation bar" feature, but have not uploaded anything to Github yet as it is not in any kind of usable state yet.

I also performed some management duties this week by assisting in task allocation and priority setting, as well as ensuring that the team is all on the same page in regards to what is expected of us this term. I ran a mini retrospective meeting to help the team understand what was good and bad about last term, as well as how we should be moving forward going into this next term.

**Week 2**
This week, I unfortunatly didn't get nearly as much work done as I had hoped to due to a number of issues in other courses, combined with mental stress from them continually piling up. I attempted to get a dynamic nav bar working, but had enough issues that I had to cut my losses, with a static and untextured nav bar being pushed to the navbar branch (not to development as it is not in a state I would consider ready to be used on other machines). I ended up having to cut my losses and focus my efforts on other courses, allowing me to clear out a large chunk of work which will allow me to dedicate most of my time next week to completing the nav bar in its entirety.

**Week 3**
This was a hectic week for me. For my first feature, I completed the implementation on a dynamic navbar on all pages of our site, complete with proper cleary laid out linking to allow users to easily navigate the site. For my second feature, I completed work on the logout system, connecting it up with the rest of the site. In addition to my 2 primary tasks, as a bonus I also refined the login and create user pages/buttons to properly redirect to their respective endpoints without opening a new page, and I assissted team member in debugging numerous errors the encountered regarding dependancies for their featrues (such as Profile, Saved Content, and general Django-React functionality), as well as advising them on what parts of their featrues were functioning incorrectly, and how to fix them.
