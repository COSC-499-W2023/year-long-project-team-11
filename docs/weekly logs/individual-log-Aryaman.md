Week 4 (1st October)
This week is where we all started to work on kickstarting the Captsone project and started laying down a base plan. We also have our project plan due in order to get a better idea of the tasks.
I helped with setting up the project plans for various tasks that were coming and due in order to make sure everyone was on the same page and had an idea as to what tasks to do for the week.
Regarding the case of the project plan, I contributed to completing it as I wrote about the overview and learned a lot about how project planning works and the functions and features that have to be taken into account while designing one.
In addition, on the 26th of September, our team decided to start working on the project plan, and a meeting was held to help decide the general tasks required for the capstone project, which had a slow start, but as we communicated with each other, we were able to get a better grip on the project and our understanding.
By 30th September we had completed the project plan and spent the time reviewing and working on our logs.

Week 5 
This week we had a meeting regarding the layout and design of the web application being coded
I helped with deciding the layout while also going through resources to learn to react and docker 
On Oct 4th I was learning new docker skills to help me set the environment for our team
We did encounter a few issues regarding as to how the coding of the documents would be gone about but was resolved quickly after communicating with the team

Week 6 (Oct 8 - Oct 15)
This week we completed the rough sketches of the user interface for the pages being made for the web application.
Additionally, we split up work for the group to complete certain tasks and be able to work towards our first major milestone of Mini presentation
To achieve this goal I started to work on using and setting a docker environment while coding using react for the required pages
We did have a few issues regarding which pages would be priority but decided to use the essential pages as the goal to display for the presentation
