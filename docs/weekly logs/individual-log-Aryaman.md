Week 4 (1st October)
This week is where we all started to work on kickstarting the Captsone project and started laying down a base plan. We also have our project plan due in order to get a better idea of the tasks.
I helped with setting up the project plans for various tasks that were coming and due in order to make sure everyone was on the same page and had an idea as to what tasks to do for the week.
Regarding the case of the project plan, I contributed to completing it as I wrote about the overview and learned a lot about how project planning works and the functions and features that have to be taken into account while designing one.
In addition, on the 26th of September, our team decided to start working on the project plan, and a meeting was held to help decide the general tasks required for the capstone project, which had a slow start, but as we communicated with each other, we were able to get a better grip on the project and our understanding.
By 30th September we had completed the project plan and spent the time reviewing and working on our logs.
