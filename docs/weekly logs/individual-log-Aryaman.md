Week 4 (1st October)
This week is where we all started to work on kickstarting the Captsone project and started laying down a base plan. We also have our project plan due in order to get a better idea of the tasks.
I helped with setting up the project plans for various tasks that were coming and due in order to make sure everyone was on the same page and had an idea as to what tasks to do for the week.
Regarding the case of the project plan, I contributed to completing it as I wrote about the overview and learned a lot about how project planning works and the functions and features that have to be taken into account while designing one.
In addition, on the 26th of September, our team decided to start working on the project plan, and a meeting was held to help decide the general tasks required for the capstone project, which had a slow start, but as we communicated with each other, we were able to get a better grip on the project and our understanding.
By 30th September we had completed the project plan and spent the time reviewing and working on our logs.

Week 5 
This week we had a meeting regarding the layout and design of the web application being coded
I helped with deciding the layout while also going through resources to learn to react and docker 
On Oct 4th I was learning new docker skills to help me set the environment for our team
We did encounter a few issues regarding as to how the coding of the documents would be gone about but was resolved quickly after communicating with the team

Week 6 (Oct 8 - Oct 15)
This week we completed the rough sketches of the user interface for the pages being made for the web application.
Additionally, we split up work for the group to complete certain tasks and be able to work towards our first major milestone of Mini presentation
To achieve this goal I started to work on using and setting a docker environment while coding using react for the required pages
We did have a few issues regarding which pages would be priority but decided to use the essential pages as the goal to display for the presentation

Week 7 (Oct 16th - Oct 22nd)
This week I helped with the docker environment 
Then proceeded to study more about node.js to start learning how to make the HTML for the logout page
I did run into issues with learning how to setup docker but learnt after how to create the file for it

Week 8 (Oct 23rd–Oct 29th)
This week was a difficult process regarding the need to rework the objectives, targets, and deliverables needed for the mini-presentation coming up in the week.
This week was utilized to rework the design for the website and change color schemes to follow during the CSS formatting for the pages as well as to use reference
I struggled a lot to set up the Javascript tests and understand how to run them but after brainstorming and working with a group member we managed to be able to run the tests and pass them
This helped me learn a lot more about JEST and Mocha as a testing framework and would help make further testing easier in the long run.

Week 9 (Oct 30th–Nov 5th)
This week consisted of group presentations where we spent time making our presentations and completing tasks to meet expectations.
In order for the presentation to be ready we all started working on a small script and prepared a presentation regarding it.
So for this week, I helped make the presentation and work on my script while also ensuring our canvas designs were ready to be presented as we had to rework upon scheme.
Finally, I worked on the automated testing to help and ran a certain condition for our login page to pass to be functional.

Week 10 (Nov 6th–Nov 12th)
This week, we were assigned new tasks to finish for the upcoming milestone.
I have been assigned to work on making a tutorial page for our users who will be using the website for the first time or would like to have a better understanding of how the website would function.
This week I took the newest pull and started making a react file for the tutorial page with a barebones layout.

Week 11-12 (Nov 13th-Nov 26th)
These 2 weeks the tasks are focused on finishing the features before the deadline and ensuring that they function with the other features.

This week I completed making the tutorial feature for the web application and now have begun focusing on the other feature that needs to be completed.

I did encounter a few issues trying to set up a page to start coding upon but after some brainstorming and asking for help from my team I was able to finish it.

Now have moved on to the next feature, which would require coding a search bar for the pages to use and filter material.
