During the break not much work was done, with the only real code changing being resolving the issue our team had last term with regards to hashing the passwords when a new user was created. During this past week, the team planned out a list of tasks and features that need to be done by the end of the month, self-assigned tasks, and begun work on our respective code portions.

This week, the team began sinking more of our time into our tasks, though a large amount of time ended up needing to be dedicated to bug fixes. Despite these set-backs however, the team managed to squash all discovered bugs, and made some great headway on our assigned features. We recognize that there is still much to do before the peer review however, and have made plans to have a fully functional website by the time of the first peer review.
The team also spent a small portion of time reorganizing tasks/assigning features as not all group members were able to attend our meetings during the first week of classes.

This week, the team successfully managed to complete the implementation of our A.I. prompt, tutorial, and user profile pages, as well as giving the AI the ability to generate slides. Each page also now possesses a nav bar, allowing for a smooth and simple way fo navigating the various pages of the site. The saved content page also had work done on it, though that feature ended up being shifted to instead complete a view page for an individual post, allowing us to better test the A.I's generation capabilities. The team struggled with numerous bugs this week relating to megre conflicts, missing dependancies, as well as failure to connect to the database, though all of these bugs have successfully been squashed. We now move into finalizing and making touch-up's to our features before our peer-review presentation this coming Thursday.

This week, the team spent most of our time testing code and performing bug fixes where necessary in preparation for the Thursday peer review session, though a few additions were made to the site including but not limimited to: adding logos and favicons, improved/easier to understand navigation, making the tutorial page more understandable, and improving the prompt a.i. to return better results.

On Thursday, the team walked a few other participants through a hueristic evaluation of our site while taking notes on what works, and what needs to be better. The team also reviewed the sites of others teams as well, providing constructive feedback where applicable.

This week, the group as a whole had midterms in other classess which sucked up most of our time. We did however begin work on implementing django tests, as well as a loading screen for the prompt page to let users know when the A.I. is thinking, as well as prevent them from asking for a new prompt while the original one is still generating. The largest part of the work done however, is that we converged all the feedback from last weeks evaluations into a set of tasks/features that need to be accomplished. These tasks are now in progress.

This week wasn't the heaviest work week for our Capstone group, as we spent most of our time wrapping up in other courses, but it was still a very productive week as we planned out a number of tasks to be completed throughout the break, with multiple deadlines ensuring that we are able to speed up progress while we have the time. We started work on the features: Access Control, updating the AI content preview to show an actual preview instead of HTML, setting up a large number of automated tests from passed features that were missed, and providing the user with warnings if the API credits are running low.
