During the break not much work was done, with the only real code changing being resolving the issue our team had last term with regards to hashing the passwords when a new user was created. During this past week, the team planned out a list of tasks and features that need to be done by the end of the month, self-assigned tasks, and begun work on our respective code portions.

This week, the team began sinking more of our time into our tasks, though a large amount of time ended up needing to be dedicated to bug fixes. Despite these set-backs however, the team managed to squash all discovered bugs, and made some great headway on our assigned features. We recognize that there is still much to do before the peer review however, and have made plans to have a fully functional website by the time of the first peer review.
The team also spent a small portion of time reorganizing tasks/assigning features as not all group members were able to attend our meetings during the first week of classes.

This week, the team successfully managed to complete the implementation of our A.I. prompt, tutorial, and user profile pages, as well as giving the AI the ability to generate slides. Each page also now possesses a nav bar, allowing for a smooth and simple way fo navigating the various pages of the site. The saved content page also had work done on it, though that feature ended up being shifted to instead complete a view page for an individual post, allowing us to better test the A.I's generation capabilities. The team struggled with numerous bugs this week relating to megre conflicts, missing dependancies, as well as failure to connect to the database, though all of these bugs have successfully been squashed. We now move into finalizing and making touch-up's to our features before our peer-review presentation this coming Thursday.

This week, the team spent most of our time testing code and performing bug fixes where necessary in preparation for the Thursday peer review session, though a few additions were made to the site including but not limimited to: adding logos and favicons, improved/easier to understand navigation, making the tutorial page more understandable, and improving the prompt a.i. to return better results.

On Thursday, the team walked a few other participants through a hueristic evaluation of our site while taking notes on what works, and what needs to be better. The team also reviewed the sites of others teams as well, providing constructive feedback where applicable.
