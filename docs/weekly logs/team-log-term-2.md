During the break not much work was done, with the only real code changing being resolving the issue our team had last term with regards to hashing the passwords when a new user was created. During this past week, the team planned out a list of tasks and features that need to be done by the end of the month, self-assigned tasks, and begun work on our respective code portions.

This week, the team began sinking more of our time into our tasks, though a large amount of time ended up needing to be dedicated to bug fixes. Despite these set-backs however, the team managed to squash all discovered bugs, and made some great headway on our assigned features. We recognize that there is still much to do before the peer review however, and have made plans to have a fully functional website by the time of the first peer review.
The team also spent a small portion of time reorganizing tasks/assigning features as not all group members were able to attend our meetings during the first week of classes.
