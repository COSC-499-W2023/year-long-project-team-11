# Week 6 
This week I worked upon implementing a doc viewer feature that lets the user preview the pptx before downloading it.
However, I did run into some trouble and would need to find a workaround for the issue.
I worked upon this code with Justin and might have to let the user preview a pdf or image version as the doc viewer does not allow it unless the website is live the code does work.
