# Week 3 (Jan 22 - Jan 28)
This week I completed my feature of slide generation, this included prompt engineering a prompt template for the AI to output in an XML format, writing a function to parse the generated XML into a powerpoint file, and writing a Django view to serve the file.

# Week 2 (Jan 15 - Jan 21)
This week I completed my merge of my AI API feature, we were previously having trouble with. I also worked with Depar on sorting out how that feature would link with his Save Content feature.

# Week 1 (Jan 8 - Jan 14)
After talking with other teams during the Thursday session, I was informed of Python libraries that other teams were using for slide generation. So this week I ended up mostly researching those libraries for slide generation (python-pptx), as well as looking at the OpenAI assistant API which another group was using to process file uploads.
