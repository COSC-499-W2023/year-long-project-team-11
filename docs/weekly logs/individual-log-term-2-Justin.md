# Week 4 (Jan 29 - Feb 4)
This week I revamped the frontend for the Prompt.js page, implemented slide themes, and worked on getting both AI generation and user authentication working on the same build in time for our firs peer review.

# Week 3 (Jan 22 - Jan 28)
This week I completed my feature of slide generation, this included prompt engineering a prompt template for the AI to output in an XML format, writing a function to parse the generated XML into a powerpoint file, and writing a Django view to serve the file.

# Week 2 (Jan 15 - Jan 21)
This week I completed my merge of my AI API feature, we were previously having trouble with. I also worked with Depar on sorting out how that feature would link with his Save Content feature.

# Week 1 (Jan 8 - Jan 14)
After talking with other teams during the Thursday session, I was informed of Python libraries that other teams were using for slide generation. So this week I ended up mostly researching those libraries for slide generation (python-pptx), as well as looking at the OpenAI assistant API which another group was using to process file uploads.
