**Week 4**
This week our team worked on writing up the project plan which I oversaw as the role of coordinator/leader. In addition to coordinating the team, I also wrote the Major Milestones section and assisted in proof-reading
and making minor adjustments/reccomendations to all other sections.

**Week 6**
This week not a whole lot happened. The milestone for this week was to fully complete the Canva design of our wepp app which was successfully completed. On Tuesday, I helped further refine the desgin by suggesting we add a wooden background to the site, as well as pursue a library-esque theme for our overall design.
