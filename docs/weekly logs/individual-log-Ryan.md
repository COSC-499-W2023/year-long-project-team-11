**Week 4**
This week our team worked on writing up the project plan which I oversaw as the role of coordinator/leader. In addition to coordinating the team, I also wrote the Major Milestones section and assisted in proof-reading
and making minor adjustments/reccomendations to all other sections.

**Week 6**
This week not a whole lot happened. The milestone for this week was to fully complete the Canva design of our wepp app which was successfully completed. On Tuesday, I helped further refine the desgin by suggesting we add a wooden background to the site, as well as pursue a library-esque theme for our overall design.

**Week 8**
This week, I spent the majority of my time focused on my leadership duties, helping revise the tasks and requirements of the group after we were presented with some new information regarding the project. I assisted in the oversight and development of new features, as well as began work on implementing a database for the project.

**Week 9**
This week I completed my assigned features of creating a database for the project, and overseeing the formulation of our presentation script, as well as refining it.

**Week 10**
This week, not a lot of coding was completed due to the group deciding that it was wiser to spend time on other courses (such as midterms and assignments) and then begin the bulk of our project partway into the break once people are feeling a bit more mentally revitalized. Despite this however, I did manage to make some alterations to the sql and docker files this week (on the database branch) to include all required fields we need for the project, as well as an update to utilize the name of our app in the database instead of a placeholder. My biggest contribution of work this week however was running our weekly team meeting to plan out and assign the tasks that needed to get done this month. These tasks, as well as who is working on what, have been added to the project board on Github.
