# Individual Log Week 1 
This week we discussed on the priority of the pages. For my side of pages I need to wait on Justin to optimize his AI. While I am waiting I am looking into fixing the git ignore issues and also into optimizing a way to have cleaner search bar and results, possibily using API.

# Individual Log Week 2
This week we discussed about synchronizing pages. For my side of pages I coordinated with Justin when he finished his AI API calls later in the week. However, I ran into issues setting up the new backend and API keys. I am hoping to finish the pages next week before prototype testing.

# Individual Log Week 3
This week we discussed about getting our individual things completed and bug fixees. For my task I made a backend that saves content and the generated content will be displayed on the saved content. For the demonstration purpose we decided that instead of showcasing the list of what is being saved it would be better to show the content that is being saved.

# Individual Log Week 4
This week we discussed about making final tests and runs before peer testing.  The feedback given after the peer testing are discussed and will be implemented in the following weeks. I mainly worked with the others to ensure my part and everyone's else parts were working as intended. In the upcoming weeks I will try to create automated testing and work on creating saving content page that allows people to view and delete generated content fully.

# Individual Log Week 5
This week we discussed about incorporating the feedback given by the users and professor. For my task I continued working on creating some more API calls for save content but also researched upon doing the automated testing. I also added a react doc viewer on the save content page so users can view their content easier.
