# Term 2
# Individual Log Week 1 
This week we discussed on the priority of the pages. For my side of pages I need to wait on Justin to optimize his AI. While I am waiting I am looking into fixing the git ignore issues and also into optimizing a way to have cleaner search bar and results, possibily using API.

# Individual Log Week 2
This week we discussed about synchronizing pages. For my side of pages I coordinated with Justin when he finished his AI API calls later in the week. However, I ran into issues setting up the new backend and API keys. I am hoping to finish the pages next week before prototype testing.

# Individual Log Week 3
This week we discussed about getting our individual things completed and bug fixees. For my task I made a backend that saves content and the generated content will be displayed on the saved content. For the demonstration purpose we decided that instead of showcasing the list of what is being saved it would be better to show the content that is being saved.

# Individual Log Week 4
This week we discussed about making final tests and runs before peer testing.  The feedback given after the peer testing are discussed and will be implemented in the following weeks. I mainly worked with the others to ensure my part and everyone's else parts were working as intended. In the upcoming weeks I will try to create automated testing and work on creating saving content page that allows people to view and delete generated content fully.

# Individual Log Week 5
This week we discussed about incorporating the feedback given by the users and professor. For my task I continued working on creating some more API calls for save content but also researched upon doing the automated testing. I also added a react doc viewer on the save content page so users can view their content easier.

# Individual Log Week 6
This is the week going into reading break. Sadly I havent worked much this week but my plan is to some more work to make up for previous week. Currently I have done some basic backend setup for save content.

# Individual Log Week 7-8
During Week 7 we mainly discussed about doing some catchup work and implementing a feature by the end of a week. I fully implemented the backend that allows for saving content. I also reviewed and tested code. During Week 8 I worked on editing the backend save content as we needed to change some fields and added to better suit our prompts. I had a midterm this week so I wasn't able to complete on another feature that is to optimize searching capabilities. Currently I have researched and done some basic coding. It will be on a branch called search optimize.

# Individual Log Week 9
This week was peer testing week. In order to be prepared for it we all merged and did some bug fixing. I fixed the output page and created an entirely new page named saved content to store everything there. The changes was made in time for peer testing. Other than that I am still working on optimize searching and hope to finish this week as I just recently finished my last midterm this week

# Individual Log Week 10
This week we have put our prior milestones onhold and focused on completing core features that were raised after our peer testing. I am working on sending a forget password to email. I am currently researching on how I can do it and created a basic setup on forgetpassword branch. I hope to get more done next week.
