# Individual Log Week 1 
This week we discussed on the priority of the pages. For my side of pages I need to wait on Justin to optimize his AI. While I am waiting I am looking into fixing the git ignore issues and also into optimizing a way to have cleaner search bar and results, possibily using API.

# Individual Log Week 2
This week we discussed about synchronizing pages. For my side of pages I coordinated with Justin when he finished his AI API calls later in the week. However, I ran into issues setting up the new backend and API keys. I am hoping to finish the pages next week before prototype testing.

#Individual Log Week 3
This week we discussed about getting our individual things completed and bug fixees. For my task I made a backend that saves content and the generated content will be displayed on the saved content. For the demonstration purpose we decided that instead of showcasing the list of what is being saved it would be better to show the content that is being saved.
