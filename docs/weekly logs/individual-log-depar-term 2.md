#Term 2
# Individual Log Week 1 
This week we discussed on the priority of the pages. For my side of pages I need to wait on Justin to optimize his AI. While I am waiting I am looking into fixing the git ignore issues and also into optimizing a way to have cleaner search bar and results, possibily using API.

# Individual Log Week 2
This week we discussed about synchronizing pages. For my side of pages I coordinated with Justin when he finished his AI API calls later in the week. However, I ran into issues setting up the new backend and API keys. I am hoping to finish the pages next week before prototype testing.
